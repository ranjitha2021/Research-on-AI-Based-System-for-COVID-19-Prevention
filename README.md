Abstract: Since the first report of coronavirus sickness (caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome) in Wuhan  in December 2019, it has become a public health issue in China and even around the world. On January 30, 2020, the  World Health Organization designated the outbreak as a Public Health Emerging of International Concern. This  pandemic is wreaking on societies. The significant number of cases raises concerns about the spread of the pandemic,  which may lead to the idea of bringing it to prevent further infection. Taking extreme precautions, on the other hand,  may be effective in preventing this pandemic. Therefore, this research paper focuses on implementing a prevention  measures like Face Mask and Social Distancing Detection model as an embedded vision system (The pretrained models  such as the CNN, and YOLO). And the Arduino Uno Board is used as a microcontroller, in on Temperature sensor and  hand sanitizer dispenser.
